			<p>You grow extra arms! While this spell lasts, carried items do not count against your hand size, and for 1 movement point you may pick up any or all items in your square, including 1 treasure. Picking up a tresure does not end your turn, but you cannot carry more than 1 treasure at a time.</p>
			<p>When punching, your punch affects all wizards and creatures within your reach.</p>
